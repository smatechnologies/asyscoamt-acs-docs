# Installation

The Asysco AMT ACS Integration requires an OpCon license that includes the ACS Agent type.

The integration is installed by dropping the supplied plugin (consisting of .dll files) into the **ProgramData\SAM\plugins** directory.

SMANetCom detects the Asysco AMT dll and registers the integration with OpCon.

Once registered with opCon the Asysco AMT connection can be configured and tasks can be defined.
